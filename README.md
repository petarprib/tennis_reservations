## Description

A full-stack tennis court reservation system done with React, Redux, SCSS, Node, Express and PostgreSQL. Having had to reserve tennis courts with different kinds of unresponsive and buggy sites/apps, I set myself a challenge to make a better version of it.

The basic idea is: a center offering tennis courts for rental, instead of having to make an entire new app for themselves and their clients, can make an account with the app while maintaining their client base. In order for the club to have its own client base, the players get to register with the club's account in the app, not with the app directly, but they are able to register with all the clubs they want, should they want to reserve times with them.
